Here are the older projects I've made public on GitHub.

None of these are class projects, since that would violate the school's rules.

The neural network stuff is all my old experimental neural network files. It consists of a completely customizable implementation of neural networks (you can delete layers, modify individual weights, add nodes, freeze training...etc.) build from numpy, as well as some basic functions build on top on Tensorflow/Keras to help training. There are also some visualization functions in here, a basic implementation of a neural network which is from a book I read, and finally some remnants of early versions of an algorithm I came up with, which work on the iris and bank datasets.

GuessTwoo I've finally stopped working on (after many, many years). It's a social media platform and pretty much the first code that I wrote.
